# Trading-Technical-Indicators
Self Project in Finance
Created a program to output the long and short opportunities for swing trading based on technical analysis using patterns and indicators
This is just a passion project that I am working on bit by bit during my free time.

Till now its a very robust program which can be read and understood easily. Furthermore, the design of the code has been made such that modifying it to add new features it made really simple.Right now it searches for long and short opportunites from 100 stocks. If needed we can add more to it and also add new assets like crypto, commodities or derivatives.

One interesting improvement in my mind is to quantify a global risk so that others can use this too,
I am working on it right now, with an idea to get risk as an number between 1-10 and then using it across the program.
Trend detection using scikit-learn and implementing that are in progress too
