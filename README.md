# Trading-Technical-Indicators
Self Project in Finance
Created a program to output the long and short opportunities for swing trading based on technical analysis using patterns and indicators
This is just a passion project that I am working on bit by bit during my free time.

One interesting improvement in my mind is to quantify a global risk so that others can use this too,
I am working on it right now, with an idea to get risk as an number between 1-10 and then using it across the program.
